   - Try editing content (won't affect real data in development)
   - Test image uploads
   - Verify all fields are working

### Deploy to Production

   ```powershell
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Follow the steps in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `frontend/build`

3. **Enable Netlify Identity:**
   - Enable Identity service in Netlify dashboard
   - Enable Git Gateway
   - Invite team members to access CMS
