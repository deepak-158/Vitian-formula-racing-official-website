# âœ… CMS Admin Access - FIXED!

## Problem Solved
The issue was that React Router was intercepting the `/admin` route, preventing access to the Netlify CMS admin interface.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated React Router
- Added `/admin` and `/admin/*` routes that redirect to `/admin/index.html`
- Created `AdminRedirect` component that handles the redirection

### 2. Fixed Redirects Configuration
- Updated `_redirects` file to properly handle admin routes
- Ensured `/admin` redirects to `/admin/index.html`

### 3. Stable CMS Version
- Using Decap CMS v3.0.14 (stable version)
- Simplified admin interface initialization

## How to Access CMS

### Development Mode
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the CMS:**
   - Primary: `http://localhost:3001/admin`
   - Direct: `http://localhost:3001/admin/index.html`

### Production Mode (After Deployment)
1. **Access the CMS:**
   - Primary: `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin`
   - Will prompt for Netlify Identity login

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Local Development
